# Operating Systems

### Thread vs Process
A thread is a light weight process and forms a basic unit of CPU utilization.
A process can perform more than one task at the same time by including multiple threads.
A thread has its own program counter, register set, and stack.
A thread shares with other threads of the same process the code section, the data section, files and signals.

A process is a program under execution. The value of program counter (PC) indicates the address of the current instruction of the process being executed. Each process is represented by a Process Control Block (PCB).


### Critical section 
1. mutual exclusion: if a process is executing in its critical section, no other process can enter.
2. progress:
3. bounded waiting


### semaphore
a value that is accessed only through two atomic operations: wait() and signal().
1. counting semaphore
2. mutex


### deadlock
1. mutual exclusion
2. hold and wait
3. no preemption: a resource cannot be taken util it has been released
4. circular wait

### Virtual memory

The idea of VM is to use disk to extend RAM. Running processes donâ€™t need to care whether the memory is from RAM or disk.

A page is a block of virtual memory.
A frame is a block of physical memory or random access memory.
A page table is a mapping between a page to the frame
