# Datadog: From Nothing To Everything

Datadog is fantastic, and I had been a long term user since beginning of it, but I never got a chance to set it up from scratch. After I joined my current company last year, which was lacking the visibility of their application running status and kubernetes infrastructure with New Relic, I realized the time had finally come.

## Custom Metrics

## APM

## Trace Search

## Logs

## Integrations
### Rails
```ruby
  Datadog.configure do |c|
    c.use :aws,                       service_name: "#{namespace}-aws"
    c.use :rails,                     service_name: "#{namespace}-rails", distributed_tracing: true
    c.use :active_model_serializers,  service_name: "#{namespace}-ams"
    c.use :active_record,             service_name: "#{namespace}-active-record"
    c.use :dalli,                     service_name: "#{namespace}-dalli"
    c.use :elasticsearch,             service_name: "#{namespace}-es"
    c.use :http,                      service_name: "#{namespace}-http", distributed_tracing: true
    c.use :faraday,                   service_name: "#{namespace}-faraday-http",
                                      distributed_tracing: true
    c.use :redis,                     service_name: "#{namespace}-redis"
    c.use :resque,                    service_name: "#{namespace}-resque"
    c.use :sidekiq,                   service_name: "#{namespace}-sidekiq"
    c.use :concurrent_ruby,           service_name: "#{namespace}-concurrent-ruby"

    c.analytics_enabled = true

    c.tracer enabled: true,
             priority_sampling: true,
             hostname: ENV['DATADOG_HOST'] || '127.0.0.1',
             port: ENV['DATADOG_APM_PORT'] || 8126,
             env: ENV['RAILS_ENV'],
             tags: {
               'component' => ENV['COMPONENT_NAME'],
               'az' => ENV['AZ']
             }
  end
```
