# Datadog: From Nothing To Everything

Datadog is fantastic, and I had been a long term user since beginning of it, but I never got a chance to set it up from scratch. After I joined my current company last year, which was lacking the visibility of their application running status and kubernetes infrastructure with New Relic, I realized the time had finally come.

In this article, I will explain how I set up a whole monitoring stack for our applications and infrastructure.

For now Datadog consists of three major components: metrics, APM and logging.

## Custom Metrics

## APM

## Trace Search

## Logs

## Management
There are some ways to achieve this, for instance grosser's [kennel](https://github.com/grosser/kennel). However due to the stack of our infrastructure, I decided to move on with Terraform.

### Monitor
```
variable "ssl_certificate_expiry_thresholds" {
  default = {
    ok       = 30
    warning  = 14
    critical = 7
  }
}

resource "datadog_monitor" "ssl_certificate_expiry_soon" {
  name  = "SSL Certificate will expire soon"
  type  = "metric alert"
  query = "avg(last_1h):avg:ssl_cert_probe.days_to_expiry{*} by {hostname} <= ${var.ssl_certificate_expiry_thresholds["critical"]}"

  message = <<EOT
- The SSL Certificate will expire soon.
- Renew the certificate.

"@slack-chapter-devops"
EOT

  thresholds = "${var.ssl_certificate_expiry_thresholds}"

  tags = [
    "severity:critical",
  ]
}
```
### Dashboard
```
locals {
  unity_app_tag                = "app:unity"
  unity_rails_deployment_tag   = "deployment:unity-rails"
  unity_sidekiq_deployment_tag = "deployment:unity-sidekiq"
  unity_release_tag            = "release:unity"
  unity_rds_name_tag           = "name:beepay-prod-postgres"
  unity_redis_identifier_tag   = "name:be-prd-red"
}

resource "datadog_timeboard" "unity" {
  title       = "Unity (created via Terraform)"
  description = "created using the Datadog provider in Terraform"
  read_only   = true

  template_variable {
    name    = "stage"
    prefix  = "stage"
    default = "prod"
  }

  template_variable {
    name    = "apm_env"
    prefix  = "env"
    default = "unity-production"
  }

  graph {
    title     = "CPU"
    viz       = "timeseries"
    autoscale = true

    request {
      q          = "avg:kubernetes.cpu.usage.total{${local.unity_app_tag},$stage} by {kubernetesclust
er}"
      type       = "line"
      aggregator = "avg"

      style {
        palette = "dog_classic",
        type    = "solid",
        width   = "thin"
      }
    }

    request {
      q    = "avg:kubernetes.cpu.limits{${local.unity_app_tag},$stage} by {kubernetescluster}*1000000
000"
      type = "line"

      style {
        palette = "warm",
        type    = "solid",
        width   = "normal"
      }
    }

    request {
      q    = "avg:kubernetes.cpu.requests{${local.unity_app_tag},$stage} by {kubernetescluster}*1000000000"
      type = "line"

      style {
        palette = "warm",
        type    = "solid",
        width   = "normal"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
