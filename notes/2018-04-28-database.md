# Database

### Transaction:
A sequence of db operations performed as a single logical unit of work.

### ACID:
atomicity : a transaction must be an atomic unit of work. either all of them are performed or none of them.
consistency: a transaction must leave all data in a consistent state, that is, maintain data integrity.
isolation: modifications by concurrent transactions must be isolated from each other.
durability : a transactionâ€™s effect is permanently saved in place in the system.

### Keys
Super: a set of attributes of a relation schema upon which all attributes of the schema are functionally dependent. No two rows can have the same value of super key attributes.
candidate: the minimal/least subset super key.
primary: one of the candidate key.  there can be only one primary key in one table.
foreign: a field that uniquely identifies a row of another table.

### PRIMARY vs. UNIQUE
primary cannot have null, can only have one in a table.
unique can be null, can have multiple in a table.

### Database normalization:
a process of analyzing the given relation schemas based on their functional dependencies to achieve:
1. minimizing redundancy
2. minimizing the insertion, deletion, and update.

### Terms
SQL: structured query language
DDL: data definition language. SQLs like CREATE, ALTER, DROP and RENAME
DML: data manipulation language . SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE
DCL: data control language. GRANT, REVOKE.

### HAVING vs. WHERE
having: a condition for a group or an aggregate function used in select statement.
where:  selects before grouping.
having: selects rows after grouping.

e.g. print duplicate rows.
```sql
SELECT name, section FROM tbl
GROUP BY name, section
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
```

### View
A virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
```
can represent a subset of the data contained in a table.
can join and simplify multiple tables into one single virtual table, acts as aggregated table.
hide the complexity of data.
takes very little space to store. only the definition of the view, not a copy of data.
can provide extra security based on the engined used.

<b>materialized view<b/>
disk based and are updated periodically based upon the query definitions, must be synchronized with its associated base tables.
<b>dynamic views</b>
virtual only and run the query definition each time they are accessed.

### Index
a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and the use of more storage space to maintain extra copy.

clustered and non-clustered index
clustered index is the index according to which data is physically stored on disk.
non-clustered index does not define physical data order but logical order. normally b+ or b- tree.

### CHAR vs. VARCHAR
differ in storage and retrieval.
CHAR column length is fixed while VARCHAR length is variable.
maximum num of chars CHAR can hold is 255. VARCHAR ups to 4000.
CHAR is 50% faster than VARCHAR.
CHAR uses static memory allocation while VARCHAR uses dynamic memory allocation.

### Lock Models
<b>Shared lock</b>
is a row-level read-only lock. two transactions are granted read access.
<b>Exclusive lock</b>
allows only one user /connection to update.
<b>Update lock</b> 
the main difference between exclusive and update is that you can acquire an update lock when another user already has a shared lock on the same record.


### Isolation level
<b>Serializable</b> transactions are isolated to each other.
<b>Repeatable reads</b> data cannot be updated during read.
<b>Read committed</b> data being read can be updated by another transaction. Can cause Non-repeatable read.
<b>Read uncommitted</b> a transaction can read uncommitted data of another transaction. Can cause dirty read.

### Concurrency issues
<b>Dirty read</b> read uncommitted data
<b>Nonrepeatable read</b> data changed during read.
<b>Phantom read</b> new data has been added during read.
