# Ni Hao! 

Hi, 

Thanks for reading. 

This is not a blog, the reason I'm writing this is to find a place to encapsulate the notes which I believe are valuable, and just in case, might be valuable for others. However you may find these notes are unorganized, and indeed you are correct, but that is just a simple consequence of my laziness.

Occasionally I would share some docs here when I've read good books, figured out interesting problems and algorithms. 


Regards,

Linyao
