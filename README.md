# Ni Hao! 

Hello, 

Thanks for reading. 

Before you click any link in the sidebar, please know this is not a blog. 
The reason I'm maintaining this site is to use a place to encapsulate 
the notes which I believe are valuable, and just in case, might be 
valuable for others. Occasionally I would share some docs here when I've 
read good books, figured out interesting problems and algorithms. However 
you may find these notes are unorganized, and indeed it is plausible --
it is the consequence of my laziness.

May the force be with you.
